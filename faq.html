<h2>So whats the deal, am I going to get spammed to death now?</h2>
<p>Noooooo! we do not and will never share your details with anyone else, be it marketeers, retailers or game developers. Our service would not function without your trust and we would never break that.</p>


<h2>How do I unsubscribe?</h2>
<p>Each e-mail should have a 'Unsubscribe' link at the very bottom.</p>


<h2>I unsubscribed but I still keep getting e-mails!</h2>
<p>Crikey, something went wrong me thinks. Send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:help@.co.uk">help@</a> and we will fix it for you.</p>

<h2>The deal(s) you e-mailed do not work, the price has changed or is no longer available?</h2>
<p>We try extremely hard to make available any restrictions, limits or time-sensitive information when listing deals or prices. Sometimes retailers will just hike up prices when they feel like it so sometimes it is out of our hands.</p>

<h2>I have a deal/service/website that I think your users would be interested in?</h2>
<p>Hooray. e-mail us please.</p>
